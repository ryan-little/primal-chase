# Primal Chase V1 Design Document
## Date: 2026-02-13

## Vision

A text-based, browser-playable survival strategy game where you play as an apex predator (big cat) being persistence-hunted by prehistoric humans. The game is intentionally unwinnable — the goal is to survive as long as possible while managing status bars and making tactical decisions through procedurally generated encounters.

**Tagline:** *Outrun Their Speed, Outlast Their Stride*

**Core Fantasy:** The biological horror of persistence hunting, experienced from the prey's perspective.

---

## Target Metrics

- Average run: ~7 days (14 decisions)
- Good run with smart play: ~12-15 days
- Exceptional luck + perfect play: 20-30+ days
- Pure push dies by day 5, pure trot caught by day 12

---

## Tech Stack

- **Approach:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build step, no dependencies
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (ryan-little/primal-chase), custom domain primalchase.com later
- **Git workflow:** `main` branch holds docs/context, `v1` branch for development, merge when ready
- **All balance numbers in a single `config.js`** — easily tunable without touching game logic

---

## Core Game Loop

### Turn Structure

Each turn = 1 full day with two phases:

1. **DAY PHASE** — See vitals, hunter distance, generated situation, choose from 3-5 actions
2. **NIGHT PHASE** — Updated vitals, new hunter intel, reduced action set with reduced costs

### Status Bars

| Bar | Range | Primary Drain | Kill Condition |
|-----|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Heat | 0-100% | Actions + daytime | Reaches 100% |
| Stamina | 100-0% | Movement | Reaches 0% |
| Thirst | 0-100% | Actions + daytime (75% day, 50% night vs heat) | Reaches 100% |
| Hunger | 0-100% | Constant drain + double on push | Reaches 100% |

### Actions

**Always available:**
- **Push** — Double distance, heavy stat cost
- **Trot** — Normal distance, moderate stat cost
- **Rest** — Zero distance, recover heat + stamina, hunters gain ground

**Situational (generated by encounters):**
- **Drink/Dig** — Reset thirst, costs time (hunters gain)
- **Eat/Scavenge** — Reset hunger + half thirst, costs time + heat

### Starting Conditions

- Heat: 0%, Stamina: 100%, Thirst: 0%, Hunger: 0%
- Hunter distance: 25 miles

## Hunter Pursuit System (Hybrid Model)

Hunters have a constant base speed with situational modifiers — no status bars of their own.

### States

1. **Pursuit Mode (default)** — Base speed (tunable, starts ~5 mph/day), modified by terrain
2. **Tracking Mode** — Triggered when player "loses" hunters via encounters (river crossing, storms, scent masking). Reduced speed for 1-3 days while they find the trail.
3. **Escalation** — Each time hunters are lost and re-find the trail, their base speed increases by a tunable increment (+0.5 per loss, etc). The noose always tightens.

### Situational Modifiers

- **After visiting water:** +speed boost (filling water skins)
- **Mountain terrain:** -speed penalty
- **Jungle/dense terrain:** -speed penalty
- **Open plains:** +speed boost

### The Inevitability Guarantee

The escalating speed after each trail loss is the mathematical guarantee that the game is unwinnable long-term. Early losses buy real breathing room. Later losses buy diminishing returns. The player should feel the walls closing in.

## Encounter System (Hybrid)

### Layer 1 — Combinatorial Generator

Each situation assembled from 3 modular slots:

| Slot | Purpose | Target Count |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Terrain Features | Where you are (dry riverbed, acacia grove, salt flat...) | ~20 |
| Opportunities | What's available (vulture circling, shade, fresh tracks, mud wallow...) | ~30 |
| Pressure Modifiers | What's threatening (overheating, hunters gaining, storm, injured paw...) | ~15 |

**Potential combinations: ~9,000 unique situations.**

Each component has:
- Narrative text fragments that compose into a full situation description
- Mechanical effects (which actions become available, cost modifiers)
- Compatibility rules (no "watering hole" in "salt flat" without specific override)

### Layer 2 — Hand-Crafted Signature Encounters (~50+)

Fully written, scripted moments that override the generator when triggered:
- Unique narrative, unique choices, unique outcomes
- Weighted to appear at most once per run
- Some gated behind day thresholds (day 10+ encounters reward long runs)
- Examples: river crossings, rival predators, brush fires, stampedes

### Layer 3 — Rare/Legendary Events (<1% chance)

Ultra-rare situations that create shareable stories:
- Mammoth herd stampede, eclipse, volcanic ash cloud, etc.
- The "I can't believe that happened" moments

---

## Internal Monologue System

Between the phase result and the next decision, the animal "thinks."

### Tone Escalation by Day Range

| Days | Tone | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| 1-3 | Confident | "They'll tire before I do." |
| 4-6 | Concerned | "Why do they not stop when the sun is at its peak?" |
| 7-10 | Desperate | "My legs remember speed, but my lungs have forgotten air." |
| 10+ | Philosophical/Haunted | "I have crossed rivers, scaled ridges, bled into the dust. And still they come." |

### Triggers

- Reacts to current vitals, hunter distance, last action taken, day count
- Specific reactions to events: losing hunters, finding water, near-death moments
- Hints at the lore mystery: "What did I take from them? Why is my death worth more than all the others on this plain?"
- Combinatorial: mood tag + event tag + day range = selection from tagged pool

## UI Layout & Flow

### Screen 1: Title Screen

- Logo: "Outrun Their Speed, Outlast Their Stride" variant (primalchaselogoout.png)
- Intro narrative from game doc
- Buttons: **Start the Hunt** | **Learn to Run** | **The Longest Strides**

### Screen 2: Game Screen

- Day/Night indicator + day counter
- Four color-coded status bars (amber/red gradient)
- "THE HUNT" — hunter distance + atmospheric flavor text
- "THE CURRENT SITUATION" — generated encounter narrative
- Internal monologue (italic, distinct styling)
- Action buttons (clickable, not text input — mobile friendly)
- Brief outcome text on selection, then transition to next phase

### Screen 3: Death Screen

- Cause-specific death narrative (caught, heatstroke, dehydration, starvation, exhaustion)
- Final score: Days Survived, Distance Covered, Times Lost Hunters
- Notable achievements from the run
- **Share Your Stride** button (clipboard text + generated image)
- **Submit to The Longest Strides** (local storage leaderboard)
- **Try Again**

### Visual Style

- Dark background with earthy savanna palette from logos
- Colors: deep brown (#2a1a0e), amber/orange (#d4883a), red for danger, muted gold highlights
- Atmospheric, dusty, primal feel
- Status bars with color transitions (green -> amber -> red as danger increases)

## Lore (TBD — V1 Seeds)

The reason the hunters are obsessed with this specific animal is intentionally left as mystery in V1. The internal monologue plants questions without answering them. Possible directions for future versions:

- Rite of passage: killing the king of the savanna proves a hunter's worth
- Spiritual: the animal's markings are believed to hold power
- Revenge: the animal killed one of their tribe
- Ecological: you're the last of your kind and they know it
- Left ambiguous: the mystery itself is the point

## Future Version Ideas (Captured for Later)

### V2 Candidates
- **Multiple playable animals** with different stat weights (elephant = tanky/slow, gazelle = fast/fragile)
- **Linear path with branches** — procedural terrain sequence with fork choices (river valley vs mountain pass)
- **Hunter V1 model** — hunters have their own status bars, can be affected by terrain/weather
- **Night phase expansion** — more night-specific encounters and actions

### V3 Candidates
- **Simple grid map** — small procedural grid with visible biome tiles, water sources, food spawns
- **2D sprite-based visuals** — animated sprites, tile-based movement
- **Difficulty modes** — easy (ideal starting conditions), normal, hard (start with some bar pressure)
- **Biome-specific encounter pools** — different situation tables per terrain type

### V4+ Candidates
- **Backend + global leaderboard** — server-side score verification and ranking
- **Multiplayer** — race mode (two players fleeing simultaneously, compare scores)
- **Seasonal events** — time-limited encounters or modifiers
- **Procedural world generation** — full Civilization-style map with fog of war
