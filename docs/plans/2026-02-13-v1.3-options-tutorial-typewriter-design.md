# V1.3 Options, Tutorial, Typewriter & Transition Polish Design

## Summary

Add an options screen with persistent settings, a fixed tutorial Day 1, typewriter effects on situation and death text, phase transition bar animations with action lockout, rewrite and center-align the intro text, and add a return-to-title button on the death screen.

## 1. Options Screen

- Small "Options" text link centered **below** the horizontal title button row
- New screen (`screen-options`) with settings:
  - **Difficulty**: Normal (default). Easy/Hard shown greyed out as "Coming Soon"
  - **Show Opening**: Toggle (default: ON). Controls typewriter intro on game start
  - **Typewriter Effect**: Toggle (default: ON). Controls typewriter on situation text and death narrative
- Stored in `localStorage` key `primalChaseOptions`
- Loaded on page init, read by UI code wherever relevant
- "Return to Title" back button on options screen

### Title Screen Layout

```
           [ Logo ]
[Learn to Run] [Start the Hunt] [The Longest Strides]
                  Options
```

## 2. Death Screen Updates

- Add **"Return to Title"** button on death screen
- Death narrative uses typewriter effect (respects the Typewriter Effect option toggle)
- Same skip mechanic: spacebar (desktop) / tap (mobile) to instant-reveal

## 3. Fixed Tutorial Day (Day 1)

- Day 1 Day phase: hand-crafted signature encounter that teaches core mechanics through atmospheric writing
  - Terrain introduces the savannah, opportunity presents water or food naturally, pressure hints at the hunters
  - Actions teach push/trot/rest tradeoffs through descriptive text
  - Not hand-holdy — just well-crafted encounter writing that makes mechanics self-evident
- Day 1 Night phase: second curated encounter teaching night mechanics
  - Reduced heat, hunters camp, rest is valuable, movement is slower
- From Day 2 onward, normal random encounter generation resumes
- Tutorial encounters are signature encounters (max once per run, day-gated to day 1)

## 4. Typewriter Effect on Situation Text

- When Typewriter Effect option is ON:
  - Encounter text types out character-by-character on each new phase
  - Death narrative also types out on the death screen
  - Speed configurable in `CONFIG` (default ~20ms/char)
  - Spacebar or tap to instant-reveal full text
  - **Action buttons disabled** until text finishes typing or is skipped
- When OFF: text appears instantly, buttons immediately available

## 5. Phase Transition Animation

When phase changes (day to night or night to day):

1. **Action buttons disabled** for the transition duration (~2s)
2. Background color shifts smoothly (already works via `body.night-mode` CSS transitions)
3. Status bars **animate** value changes — bars visually slide to new widths over ~1.5s instead of snapping
4. After transition completes, action buttons re-enable
5. Then typewriter begins for new encounter text (if enabled)

Safeguard: players cannot select actions during the transition period.

## 6. Typewriter Intro Rewrite

- **Center-aligned** text (change from left-aligned)
- Rewrite the intro paragraphs to reflect the hunt **starting** rather than already being mid-chase:
  1. You are the apex predator. This land is yours. Confidence.
  2. But something is different today. Figures on the distant horizon.
  3. They don't charge. They don't rush. They just walk toward you.
  4. Something primal tells you to move.
  5. The chase begins.
- Arc: confidence → unease → dread → flight

## 7. Files Affected

- `index.html` — options screen markup, death screen button, options link on title
- `css/style.css` — options screen styles, options link style, typewriter situation styles, transition animation timing, centered intro text, death button additions
- `js/ui.js` — options load/save, typewriter engine for situation/death text, phase transition lockout, tutorial encounter routing, intro text rewrite + centering
- `js/config.js` — typewriter speed config, transition duration config
- `js/encounters.js` — tutorial Day 1 signature encounters (day + night)
- `js/game.js` — tutorial encounter routing for Day 1, phase transition timing hooks
