You are an apex predator — a king of the savannah. Behind you, persistent hunters who do not tire, do not stop, and do not forget. The chase has begun.

Every decision costs something. Push hard and risk collapse. Rest and let them close the gap. Find water before thirst takes you. The land shifts beneath your paws — dry riverbeds, fever trees, open plains — each with its own dangers and fleeting opportunities.

The game is unwinnable. The only question is how long you last.
